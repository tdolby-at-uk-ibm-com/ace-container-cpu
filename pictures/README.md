# pictures

These pictures were generated using Excel and the data in the raw-data directory.

The approach taken was to create a "Success" column, and plot that as a function
of the elapsed milliseconds to create a more obvious visual effect than would
have been achieved by merely plotting the response times: showing the gaps that
occur due to throttling is much easier without the noise of the response times.
